This is CMPE-264 Computer Vision Project 1. It includes four parts-

1. Obtain eight images with different exposure times from a mobile camera and plot the non-linear curve between brightness B and exposure time T for different color channels for each image. A linear regression is then used to obtain a linear function between B and T.
